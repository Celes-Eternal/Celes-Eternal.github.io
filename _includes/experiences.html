      <p>
       I worked on a project manager, which had to adapt to some very complex process from SKF.
       I made a prototype in VBA which was used by several SKF factories.
       And I started to work on the architecture of the final product (C# MVC client and C++ Server).
       </br></br>
       I had to fully manage every aspect of the project (clients, boss...). It's my best professional experience at the moment.
